### Fitness Club Application

The main purpose of this web application is to store test information of club members for later analysis.

This web application is built using React and Vite, two popular front-end development tools that offer fast performance
and a streamlined developer experience. The application's styles were written using SASS. The application's frontend
also leverages the power of PrimeReact, a set of open-source UI components for React that provide a polished and
professional user interface. The backend is powered by Superbase, an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a real-time
database and authentication system. With Superbase, the application stores data for registered users, client
information, and test results in a secure and scalable database. By combining the power of React, Vite, PrimeReact, and
Superbase, this application delivers a modern and user-friendly experience for fitness club members and trainers alike.
