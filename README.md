Fitness Club Application is a web application designed to store club members test information for future analysis.

This web application is built using React and Vite, two popular front-end development tools that offer fast performance
and a streamlined developer experience. The application's styles were written using SASS, a popular preprocessor for CSS
that offers additional features like variables, mixins, and nested rulesThe application's frontend also leverages the
power of PrimeReact, a set of open-source UI components for React that provide a polished and professional user
interface. The backend is powered by Superbase, an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a real-time database
and authentication system. With Superbase, the application stores data for registered users, client information, 
and test results in a secure and scalable database. By combining the power of React, Vite, PrimeReact, and Superbase, 
this application delivers a modern and user-friendly experience for fitness club members and trainers alike.
